Remove Duplicate Code In Constructors Refactoring
=================================================

Summary
=======
A Java refactoring to remove duplicate code in constructors by delegating work to other constructors in the class wherever possible.

Components
==========

Our core refactoring source code consists of the refactoring itself, the UI components for the refactoring, utility methods, and visitors, and is broken down into three packages. The full refactoring source documentation was autogenerated using Doxygen, in the 'doc' folder.

1) Core & UI (edu.illinois.canistelCassabanana)

   This package contains the core refactoring source, including the refactoring itself, the eclipse UI components, and boiler plate code to launch the refactoring source.

2) Utilities (edu.illinois.canistelCassabanana.utility)

   Contains modular, reusable utility functions that do not require any state. These functions include type lookup functions, finding constructors from a compilation unit and vice versa, and additional shared functions.

3) Visitors (edu.illinois.canistelCassabanana.visitors)

   Contains visitors that traverse the AST tree to retrieve particular types of AST nodes, including assignments, constructor declarations & invocations, field variables, and type declarations. We chain these visitors to perform tasks such as finding all field variables appearing in assignments inside of constructors.
